# IRPF – Interface RPF Framework
IRPF is a modular, extensible IDE and framework for interacting with Rockstar’s RPF-based game formats.  
Built with C#, powered by CodeWalker.API, and designed for long-term cross-game modding, asset management, RPF exploration, and automated workflows.

## 🚀 What is IRPF?
IRPF provides a unified toolchain for:

- RPF extraction, browsing, and repacking  
- File and metadata editing  
- DLC merging    
- Plugin-driven feature expansion  
- Multi-backend architecture (RPF7, RPF8 in future)  
- Multi-game support (GTA V, RDR2, MP3, future GTA VI)

IRPF is meant to evolve alongside Rockstar titles, becoming a long-term foundation for the entire modding ecosystem.
